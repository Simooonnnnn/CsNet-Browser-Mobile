# 🌐 CsNet Browser
### The Chrome replacement absolutely nobody asked for, but here we are

Are you tired of browsers that just work? Looking for a fresh way to question your life choices? Well, you're in luck! Introducing CsNet Browser for mobile devices – because apparently, the world needed another browser.

## ✨ Features That Will Blow Your Mind (or at least mildly interest you)

### 🤖 CsNet Summary AI
Ever wished your search results were shorter? Our groundbreaking AI technology does exactly what it says on the tin: it takes your perfectly good search queries and turns them into bullet points. Because reading full sentences is so 2023.

### 📑 Tabs! (Yes, really)
Revolutionary feature alert: you can open multiple tabs! We know, we know – contain your excitement. Welcome to the future, where you can have more than one webpage open at a time. What will they think of next?

### 🎨 Dynamic Material You Colors
Because nothing says "modern browser" like matching your phone's theme. Watch in amazement as CsNet Browser changes colors to match your wallpaper. It's like a chameleon, but with more JavaScript errors.

### 🚀 Browse the Web with Ease*
*Results may vary. "Ease" is a relative term. But hey, it loads websites! Most of the time. When it feels like it.

### 🆕 Frequent Updates
We're constantly pushing updates because:
1. We love breaking things that previously worked
2. We keep finding bugs we swear weren't there before
3. Someone keeps letting the intern push to production

## 🔮 Coming Soon™
- Even more Material You integration (because you clearly need more)
- A settings page that might actually save your settings
- Bug fixes that will probably introduce new bugs
- Features you didn't ask for but will get anyway

## 💪 System Requirements
- A mobile device (preferably one you're not too attached to)
- The patience of a saint
- Low expectations
- A backup browser (just in case)

## 🤝 Contributing
Found a bug? Want to contribute? Well, isn't that nice of you! Feel free to open an issue or submit a PR. We promise to look at it eventually, probably, maybe.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
CsNet Browser is not responsible for:
- Lost productivity
- Existential crises
- The urge to go back to Chrome
- Climate change
- Your phone's sudden identity crisis from all the Material You theming

## 📱 Installation
1. Download CsNet Browser
2. Question your decisions
3. Install anyway
4. ???
5. Browse the web!

Remember: It's not a bug, it's a feature you haven't discovered yet!
